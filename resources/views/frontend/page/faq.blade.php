                                    The 3D Secure password is an additional password that you will be asked to enter after entering your card details on the payment page. 
                                    You will be redirected to your individual bank’s page where you'll have to enter the <b>Verified by Visa</b> password for Visa cards or <b>SecureCode</b> password for MasterCard cards. 
                                    Your card-issuing bank will give this password to you and you should have this password prior to shopping on Makeup Biography.

                                      <li>Though, we keep 95% of our catalogue in our inventory, certain products need to be sourced directly from the brand itself so that we can live up to our promise of providing fresh, non-expired products.</li>
                                      <li>While we are trying our best to avoid this situation, these products might delay your order.</li>
                                      <li>If you are ordering our products from a Mega Sale event, dispatches may be a bit delayed due to increased volumes. We will target to dispatch all orders within 5 days of order date.</li>

                                    We are pleased to say, more than 95% of Makeup Biography orders are delivered within 3-5 business days from the date of order.

                                    Our delivery partners then bring the package to you at the earliest. In case, they are unable to reach your provided address or at a suitable time, they will contact you to resolve the issue.

                                    <b>What measures does Makeup Biography take to ensure the products are not damaged during delivery?</b>
                                    <br>
                                    We at Makeup Biography maintain a very high level of quality control and till date, we have received minimal complaints about the quality of our packaging.
                                    <br>
                                    Furthermore, less than 0.5% of our products we ship in a year are returned to us as damaged. To ensure your products remain undamaged during the shipping process, we package our products in boxes, which are covered in plastic layers. 
                                    Each individual product is then packaged in bubble wrap while fragile items like bottles are safely secured with additional bubble wrap.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <b>Do the storage systems ensure that the quality of the products is intact?</b>
                                    <br>
                                    95% of our inventory is kept in our warehouse. Since we only sell our freshest products, the remaining 5% of our stock is sourced from the brand as soon you place your order. This would take an additional 2-3 days for delivery.
