                    <br>
                    In case of cancellation before shipment, we process the refund within 24 - 48 business hours after receiving the cancellation request.
                    <br>
                    In case of cancellation once the shipment has already been dispatched or if it is being returned, we process the refund once the products have been received and verified at our warehouse.
                    <br>
                    <ul>

                            For <b>payments done through credit/debit cards or net banking</b>, the refund will be processed to the same account from which the payment was made within 24-48 business hours of us receiving the products back. 
                            It may take 2 - 3 additional business days for the amount to reflect in your account.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For <b>cash on delivery transactions</b>, we will initiate a bank transfer against the refund amount against the billing details shared by you. This process will be completed within 24-48 business hours of us receiving the products back and your bank details on email. 
                            It will take an additional 2 - 3 business days for the amount to reflect in your account.

                    <strong style="font-size: 20px;">What if I used discount vouchers or loyalty points during time of payment and I have to cancel my order?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Discount vouchers are intended for one-time use only and shall be treated as used even if you cancel the order.
                    <br>
                    If you had redeemed loyalty points for an order, the same will be credited back to your account in the case of a cancellation.
                    <br><br>

                    Well, it can mean two things:
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The order might have already been packed or shipped out; in which case you can refuse the delivery of the order. No worries!</li>
                        <li>Something might not be working as it's supposed to, on the website. Give us a call or send us an email and we'll help in fixing it.</li>
